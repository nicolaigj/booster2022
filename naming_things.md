## Solving the hardest problem in programming
### Naming things :tada:

# Why is it even a problem? 

# :thinking:
<!---
- Code is written for humans to read
- Programmers are mostly problem solvers, not writers or communicators
- It's hard to think from another perspective
- The programmer understands the code, at that time
- We don't bother really, the code runs, the tests pass, hey ho let's go

# Code is communication
# ðŸ¤“
<!---
The code we write describes how it works and what it represents to other humans
Most of us don't think about code as communication, but it really is
It tells your team, or the entire world if it's open source, 
I like to think about code in the same way I think
